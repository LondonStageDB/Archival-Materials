 to awaken the highest joy and transport in Imogen, instead of which, we wer  so

 managers could think of shoving $Mr Cautherly= into the part of +Captain Plume=
r, is, to us, a matter of surprize....The part requires elegance, vivacity and t
he easy deportment of an accomplish'd gentleman.  We never remember to have seen
 this character more completely performed, than by $Mr Smith= at +Covent Garden 
Theatre= (who is everything that criticism can wish) nor much worse, than by Mr 
Cautherly, who does not possess one requisite for the character, and is the effe
minate and insipid School-boy throughout the whole.  To this we may add, that he
 was not perfect, and made a great mistake, by coming in where he should not whi
ch oblig'd him to retire again.  This was an unpardonable fault, though it was t
he first time of his appearing in this character."--+Theatrical Review=, 2 Nov. 
 Of the afterpiece: "We were not a little pleased to observe this evening, that 
$Mr King=, in the character of +Sir Dingle=r, omitted the parody on the lines wi
th which the third act of $Otway='s +Orphan= concludes.  But we think the introd
ucing a chine of roast beef, decorated with a flag, to be carried off in triumph
 by the rabble, accompanied, from the orchestra with music of the old song of th
at title is a pitiful addition to the performance, and intended only as a sacrif
ice to the caprice of the riotous inhabitants of the upper gallery.  Had this En
tertainment been exhibited at a +French theatre= it would have had some claim to
 merit.  This seems to be a piece of stage policy, arising from a consciousness,
 that the whole performance is too contemptible to meet with countenance from an
y but the sons of riot, for which reason they are brib'd to support it, by this 
notable trick."--Theatrical Review, 2 Nov.]  Receipts: #199 7s. 6d. (Treasurer's

e of the +English stage=.  This what-shall-we-call-it...now reviv'd with alterat
ions and the addition of two new scenes, viz. two views of +Mount Vesuvius=v: th
e first of which represents a Vulcano burning at a distance, and is reflected by
 the water in the +bay of Naples=v.  The second is a nearer land view of the Mou
nts, and represents the manner in which the Lava is thrown out whenever an erupt
ion happens; the torrents of the lava, like a river of liquid fire, falling into
 a cascade from a rock.  As far as carpenters and painters are concerned, these 
additional scenes seem to be well executed, but whether the resemblance is exact
, we cannot pretend to say; though we suppose it is.  Be this as it may we canno
t help thinking, the terrific ideas these scenes naturally raise in the mind, mu
st defeat every intention of giving pleasure, and consequently afford less satis
faction to curiosity than a written account of that Vulcano, or any descriptive 
drawing of it.  Paid Printer's Bill #9 6d.  Receipts: #235 12s. 6d. (Treasurer's

ew scene, viz. a representation of the wonderful and surprizing feats lately per
formed at +Stockwell= in +Surrey=, by an invisible agent, who, we apprehend is v
ery nearly related to the celebrated +Cock-Lane Ghost= of famous Memory.  [See 2
8 Jan. 1762.]  We cannot help considering it a lucky hit and we hope it will mee
t with encouragement, as the turning the transactions of the +Stockwell Conjurer
= into ridicule may prevent that mysterious affair making improper impressions o
n the minds of the ignorant and superstitious.  When considered in this light, t
he additional scene must be acknowledged to have merit, and, we confess, it is e
xtremely well conducted to produce risibility (+Theatrical Review=, II, p. 85). 
 [See notice of the additional scene 1 Feb. and see +An Authentic...Narrative of

f $Miss Fanny=, with additions but no amendments."  The Gentleman's Magazine (Hi
storical Chronicle for 6 Jan.) mentions the explosion of two powder-mills on +Ho
unslow Heath=:  About the time explosion was felt at London, some families at St
ockwell were terrified with the ratting and braking of their china, which they a
ttributed to a preternatural cause.  A Lady of fortune was so firmly Persuaded t
hat some invisible agent was concerned, that she discharged her maid, whom she s
uspected of having an intercrouse with the wicked spirit; and when she was gone,
 as no mischief ensued, consoled herself that she had rid of so dangerous an int
imate."  See also bill for 8 Feb.]  Rec'd from $Condell= on account of Fruit ren

1772.  Shuter had been unattentive and absent from many rehearsals]: At length t
hough late [in the  season] a day was appointed for the representation, and on t
hat morning $Mr Shuter= appeared at rehearsal, pretty much in the same state as 
before, and confessed himself incapable of performing his part, that night.  Upo
n which the play was oblig'd to be further postponed, and handbills were sent ab
out at noon, to advertise town of the disappointment....A further final day was 
afterwards determined on, but the audience being out of humour at their former d
isappointment, called Mr Shuter to account for it, on his first appearance; whic
h threw him into such confusion, that he was not able to get the better of it, t
hroughtout the whole performance...in the hurry of his spirits the actor not onl
y forgot his part, the deficiency of  which he endeavoured to supply with his ow
n dialect, but also seemed to lose all idea of the character he was to perform; 
and made the +Governor=r appear in a light which the author never intended: that
 of a mean, ridiculous buffoon.  [Mrs Griffith concluded her +preface= by relati
ng how her friends stood by the piece, but two or three in the gallery, when it 
was given out again objected and threw an apple at the chandeliers, which so per
turbed the management that the play was withdrawn.  She therefore published it b
y subscription, prefixing the names of about 440 subscribers, persons of the fir
st quality, including $James Boswell=, $Edmund Burke=, $Col. Burgoyne=, the $Duk
e of Devonshire=, $David Garrick=, $Mrs Montague=, $William Richardson=, and a h

07-8: The Oratorios performed at this House were conducted by Messrs. Stanley an
d Smith, for their own emolument; the Managers of the theatre having had no Shar
e of the profit arising from these performances, nor any advantage, except a pre
mium for the use of the house.  Mr Stanley's musical abilities are well known.  
$Mr Smith=, was, if we are not mistaken, a pupil of the celebrated Mr Handel's; 
and, we believe, that Gentleman left Mr Smith the greatest part of his music, if
 not his whole library; so that Mr Smith may with great propriety claim the righ
t of succeeding $Mr Handel= in the exhibition and conduct of his Oratorios, whic
h he has undertaken (in conjunction with $Mr Stanley=) every since Mr Handel's d
eath.  Their band was composed of some of the most capital performers in this ki
ngdom, and was led by $Mr Ximenes=.  The vocal performers (exclusive of Chorus s
ingers) were $Mr Norris=, well known to all lovers of Music, for his taste and d
elicacy of execution.  $Mr Parry= (a Bass voice) from the $Cathedral Church of S
alisbury=.  This gentleman, though very young, has an extensive compass, and a g

 What this gentleman executes with the horn is very surprising, but, not being s
uited to the genius of the instrument, it is not productive of any good effect, 
when considered musically; as a matter of novelty it may surprise and please, on
 which account it is worthy the notice of the curious.  *pcg Judas Macchabeus.

s on this instrument is wonderful, when the genius of it is considered.  As this

 The plot of this piece is taken from a well known passage in history, which, ho
wever, is too barren of incidents for the support of a piece of 5 acts, on which
 account it is rather languid and tedious, notwithstanding the language in gener
al is tolerable poetical.  What could induce $Mr Reddish= to revive so dull a pe
rformance, after it had been neglected for 20 years, we cannot conceive, unless 
it was with a view of having an opportunity to rant a few speeches in favor of l
iberty; but (as the piece was miserably represented except in the characters of 
+Timoleon=r and +Eunesia=r) we think Mr Reddish extended his liberty a little to
o far with the public; for which neither his Occasional +Prologue=, the Solemn S
acrifice, nor the +Epilogue= spoken by $Miss Younge=, made sufficient atonement.

ould be an egregious falsehood.  After the play $Mr Vernon= came forward and inf
orm'd the audience that Mr Weston 'was suddenly taken ill' and could not perform
. Weston instantly started up in the front of the upper Gallery, and inform'd th

ler was much confused upon her first entrance; but from the melody of her voice,
 tho she did not raise it sufficiently in many parts, there is reason to believe
, when she was got the better of her terrors of facing an audience, that she wil
l be an acquisition to the stage, at least as a vocal performer.  Miss Bradley's
 performance of Lucy with great spirit, vivacity and Propriety' and her singing 
being so well suited to the character, she so much eclipsed Polly, that the audi

'd by Bickerstaffe.  The music by Dibdin.  I went with a party into the Gallery 
to see the event as there was a great riot expected, & indeed never did I see an
 audience more inflamed.  They would not suffer them to begin the piece.  At las
t $Mr King= came on with a written paper in his hand, which he said he was desir
'd to read in the name of the managers.  After a great noise they let him read i
t.  He said just before the play began the managers had receiv'd a letter from M
r Dibdin in which he declared that Bickerstaff was not the author of that piece,
 that he had made oath of it, and was ready to do the same again, but that for v
ery particular reasons the author could not be given up.  Then they stopp'd him 
& roar'd out that the author should be given up then.  He continued as loud as h
e possibly could, reading on that 'but that if Mr Dibdin did not very soon given
 up the author he never should be suffered to appear again on that stage or any 
other.'  Very luckily that turn'd them as I believe the House would have come do
wn.  The piece then began.  Before the end of the first act one of $Bannister='s
 songs were encor'd.  The other party were against it and would not let it go on
.  They all stood up and insisted that the author should be known then.  After s
ome time the house being nothing but confusion, Dibdin was push'd upon the stage
 ready to drop with fright, and declared that he was the author himself.  Then t
hey were as noisy the other way.  Made them finish the piece, but how you may gu
ess in a storm.  It is like the +Padlock=, but the songs not so good." ($Brander

ote her father (13 March 1773):  $Smith= has rais'd such a fury in the Town, owi
ng to $Colman='s having refus'd $Mrs Yates= to play for him, that last Saturday 
[6 March] being the fifth night of +Alzuma=, when the play ought to have begun, 
the Audience made a most violent noise, called for Colman, insisted that the pla
y should not begin till he was found & the reasons given why Mrs Yates was not s
uffered to play for Smith.  In vain did $Bensley= endeavor frequently to speak a
nd tell them that Colman was not to be found.  The still continued hissing and r
oaring, and this last till past seven o'clock.  $Dagge= and $Harris= were behind
 in a dreadful consternation least the house should be demolished, of which inde
ed it was in some danger.  At last they said something must be said to quiet the
m, when Smith in the confusion ran on and told them that the managers had consen
ted Mrs Yates should play for him.  Then they sent him off to tell them that his
 day must be settled whenever he thought proper, to give her time to come here. 
 He went off and made them fix it for the 19th of April, went on and told them i
t was settled.  They then insisted that Smith should tell them whether everythin
g was settled to his entire satisfaction.  He assured them it was.  The play was
 then ordered to begin.  I am told they have given him up his articles for three
 years, at his desire.  Several Gentlemen went round into the Hall and sent for 
Smith, telling him his private quarrels with the managers were nothing to them. 
 That if Mrs Yates play'd they should be glad to see her, but that as she was no
t in the company it was not right in him to disturb the play and hinder them fro
m seeing it.  He expostulated with them and told his story.  The Town rings with
 this affair.  Various are the opinions.  Some think it is her plan to get once 
more upon the stage, and they say there is a most powerful Party making to oppos
e her & that she shall not play that night.  Others say Colman is very wrong to 
hinder her.  I find she entirely built upon your playing for me, and there has b
een a very impatient card in the +Ledger= to Colman insisting upon his telling t
he town why Mrs Yates was hindered to play, and why $Mr Macklin= had any more ri
ght to be suffered to come over so long unmolested to play for Miss Macklin?  Bu
t that everybody sees thru'....Colman I am certain has not a thing against your 
playing for me.  He seems rather to wish for your coming....I do not think the $

+Public Advertiser=: Sir, I spent an agreeable evening lately with a Country Fri
end at the Primitive Puppet Show, and was not displeased at the ridicule pointed
 at the dull, spiritless stuff, which composes modern Sentimental Comedy.  I was
 entertained too with the manner in which some of the Actors were taken off; But
 I cannot think mimicry worthy to furnish an Evening Entertainment for a Polite 
+British Audience=, or suited to the happy ridicule and pointed wit of $Aristoph
anes=.  The old +Roman comedy=, as it was called, was designed for nobler purpos
es: it was directed to improve the head and mend the heart.  The keen manly sati
re of that Comedy was pointed at Upstart, Braggart, Vice, and to expose the dang
erous unfeeling craft of innocent Villainy, or to use the words of $Mr Pope=--Br
and the bold front of shameless, guilty man.  Such was, and such ought to be, th
e salutary Direction of Wit, and Satire by exhibiting characters in their genuin
e colours, when the mask, which disguises and conceals them from the eyes of the
 Weak the Credulous, and the Ignorant, is drawn off.  The words of $Horace= are-
