e concluding couplet of which were used by Sheridan as the Prologue to +Pizarro=
 (see +dl=, 24 May 1799)] was so much admired that at the request of the $Duches
s of Devonshire= and several other of the nobility it was respoken after the pie
ce; but as $King= was absent from the theatre, it was delivered by $Palmer=" (+T
own and Country Magazine=, May 1780, p. 23 ).  "The chief singularity was that [
$Lady Craven=] went to it herself the second night, in form; sat in the middle o
f the front row of the stage-box, much dressed, with a profusion of white bugles
 and plumes, to receive the public homage due to her sex and loveliness.  The $D
uchess of Richmond=, $Lady Harcourt=,...$Mrs Damer=, $Lord Craven=,...and I were
 with her.  It was amazing to see so young a woman entirely possess herself-but 
there is such an integrity and frankness in her consciousness of her own beauty 
and talents, that she speaks of them with a naivete as if she had no property in
 them, but only wore them as gifts of the gods.  Lord Craven on the contrary was
 quite agitated by his fondness for her and with impatience at the bad performan
ce of the actors, which was wretched indeed, yet the address of the plot, which 
is the chief merit of the piece, and some lively pencilling carried it off very 
well, though $Parsons= murdered the +Scotch lord=r, and $Mrs Robinson= (who is s
upposed to be the favourite of the $Prince of Wales=) thought on nothing but her
 own charms, or him.  There is a very good though endless prologue written by Sh
eridan and spoken in perfection by King, which was encored (an entire novelty) t
he first night: and an epilogue that I liked still better and which was full as 
well delivered by $Mrs Abington=, written by Mr. Jekyl.  The audience, though ve
ry civil, missed a fair opportunity of being gallant, for in one of those ----lo
gues, I forget which, the noble authoress was mentioned, and they did not applau
d as they ought to have done, especially when she condescended to avow her prett
y child and was there looking so very pretty...Yet Lady Craven's tranquillity ha
d nothing displeasing;...and it was tempered by her infinite good nature, which 
made her make excuses for the actors instead of being provoked at them"  ($Walpo

e and interesting among the victims-it demands an instant versatility, that yet 
must not savour of trick.  You must hear his insinuations with curses, and yet c
onfess that you also would have been deceived.  Other Iagos were to be seen thro
ugh at once...Though a studious man, there was no discipline apparent in the art

al Animosity.  "[Ansani] had a finely toned, full, and commanding voice, was a s
pirited actor, and in the first opera, called +Ricimero=, sustained the most pro
minent and important part.  But he was unfortunately of a most peevish, quarrels
ome temper; Roncaglia was saucy and conceited, and neither could brook the super
iority claimed by the other.  Their mutual jealousy, and the importance assumed 
by the tenor soon produced an irreconcilable breach, Ansani threw up his engagem
