The announcement appears to refer to the spring of 1737 and presumably appeared around the middle of March.  It is intended for the benefit of a Widow under Misfortunes and the bill bears the heading: Gift and Pleasure.  According to the announcement, the widow  has been left Italian pictures, antiqees, jewels, and precious stones; and she intends, for the encouragement of her benefactors, to make a gift of all the objects, which will be placed in three hundred parcels.  Tickets for the performance are advertised at five shillings, and no one is to be admitted without a ticket.  The pit and boxes are to be put together at two tickets for each person, and the first and second galleries are placed together at one ticket for each spectator.  The tickets are not to be left with the door-keepers as usual, but only shewn and kept.  On the day following the benefit a raffle will be held, by Mr +Foubert's Patent Mathematical Machine=, at +Hickford's Great Room= in +Brewers Street=, +Golden Square=, and only holders of tickets will be admitted to the raffle,  After this entry was set, an advertisement was found in the +Daily Advertiser=, 18 April 1738, announcing this performance for 13 May 1738.

As I am neither acquainted with him, nor the Master of the Playhouse, I cannot be accus'd of Partiality, in affirming, that I think this the best Farce this Age has produc'd.  It seems to be writ in Imitation of $Shakespear=, and entirely calculated for the present Taste.  The Characters are strong, lively, majestic, and just; the incidents natural and moving; the Conduct regular; the Distresses extremely affecting; the Stile sublime; the Sentiments grand, full of Patriotism; and the Catastrophe so masterly wrought up, that, I am persuaded, no Farce whatsoever, now acting, will draw more Tears than this.  But what affected me beyond all, was, the Zeal, the exemplary Zeal of a worthy Magistrate, who so strictly adheres to the very Letter of the Law, as to send a rich and honest Merchant, and Freeholder, to the House of Correction, as a sturdy Beggar, or Loiterer.

Boxes 5s. Pit 3s. Gallery 2s. +Victor, History of the Theatres=, I, 54-60: People went early to the Theatre, as a crouded House was certain.  I was there, in the Centre of the Pit; where I soon perceived that we were visited by two Westminster Justices, Deveil and $Manning=.  The Leaders, that had the Conduct of the Opposition, were known to be there; one of whom called aloud for the +Song in Praise of English Roast Beef=, which was accordingly sung in the Gallery by a Person prepared for that Purpose; and the whole House besides joining in the Chorus, saluted the Close with three Huzzas! This, +Justice Deveil= was pleased to say, was a Riot; upon which Disputes commenced directly, which were carried on with some Degree of Decency on both Sides.  The Justice at first informed us, 'That he was come there as a Magistrate to maintain the King's Authority; that $Colonel Pulteney=, with a full Company of the Guards, were without, to support him in the Execution of his Office; that it was the King's Command the Play should be acted; and that the obstructing it was opposing the King's Authority; and if that was done, he must read the Proclamation; after which all Offenders would be secured directly by the Guards in waiting.'  To all these most arbitrary Threatnings, this Abuse of $his Majesty='s Name, the Reply was to the following Effect:-'That the Audience had a legal Right to shew their Dislike to any Play or Actor; that the common Laws of the Land were nothing but common Custom, and the antient Usuage of the People; that the Judicature of the Pit had been acknowledged and acquiesced to, Time immemorial; and as the present Set of Actors were to take their Fate from the Public, they were free to receive them as they Pleased.'  By this Time the Hour of Six drew near; and the +French and Spanish Embassadors=, with their Ladies; the late $Lord and Lady Gage=, and $Sir T@R@=, a Commissioner of the Excise, all appeared in the Stage Boxes together!  At that Instant the Curtain drew up, and discovered the Actors standing between two Files of Grenadiers, with their Bayonets fixed, and resting on their Firelocks.  There was a Sight! enough to animate the coldest Briton.  At this the whole Pit rose, and unanimously turned to the Justices, who sat in the Middle of it, to demand the Reason of such arbitary Proceedings?  The Justices either knew nothing of the Soldiers being placed there, or thought it safest to declare  so.  At that Declaratinn, they demanded of Justice Deveil (who had owned himself the commanding Officer in the Affair) to order them off the Stage.  He did so immediately, and they disappeared.  Then began the Serenade; not only Catcalls, but all the various portable Instruments, that could make a disagreeable Noise, were brought up on this Occasion, which were continually tuning in all Parts of the House; and as an Attempt to speaking was ridiculous, the Actors retired, and they opened with a grand Dance of twelve Men and twelve Woman; but even that was prepared for; and they were directly saluted with a Bushel or two of Peas, which made their Capering very unsafe.  After this they attempted to open the Comedy; but had the Actor the voice of Thunder, it would have been lost in the confused Sounds from a thousand Various Instruments.  Here, at the waving Deviel's Hand, all was silent, and (standing up on his Seat) he made a Proposal to the House to this Effect:-'That if they persisted in the Opposition, he must read the Proclamation; that if they would permit the Play to go on, and to be acted through that Night, he would promise, (on his Honour) to lay their Dislikes, and Resentment to the Actors, before the King, and he doubted not but a speedy End would be put to their acting.'  The Answer to this Proposal was very short, and very expressive.  'No Treaties, No Treaties!'  At this the Justice called for Candles to read the Proclamation, and ordered the Guards to be in Readiness; but a Gentleman seizing Mr Deveil's Hand, stretched out for the Candle, begged of him to consider what he was going to do, for his own Sake, for ours, for the King's! that he saw the unanimous Resolution of the House; and that the Appearance of Soldiers in the Pit would throw us all into a Tumult, which must end with the Lives of many.  This earnest Remostrance made the Justice turn pale and passive.  At this Pause the Actors made a second Attempt to go on, and the Uproar revived; which continuing some Time, the Embassadors and their Ladies left their Box, which occasioned a universal. Huzza from the whole House! and after calling out some Time for the Falling of the Curtain, down it fell.

After his Speech was ended, he found a thundering Applause from the Audience, and went thro' the whole Play without any farther Disturbance.  But we ought not entirely to form out Judgment of its being the very worst Play, from what this Gentleman was pleased to say of it, in the Heat of his Resentment for being ill-treated; nor wonder that an Audience should applaud a Sentence which condemned an Author, at a Time when it was the Fashion to condemn them all, right or wrong, without being heard; and when Parties were made to go to new Plays to make Uproars, which they called by the odious Name of +The Funn of the first Night=.  For the Afterpiece, +A Compleat List=, p. 183: And on the very Night I am speaking of it, at the End of the Play, was acted for the first [second] Time a new Farce, called, +An Hospital for Fools=, of which one single Word was not heard that the Actors spoke, the Noise of these First-Night Gentlemen was so great; however, the Actors went thro' it, and the Spectatbrs might see their Mouths wag, and that was all.  *pyQcg Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.

It is not any distortion of Body or unnatural transposition of the limbs which they exhibit to the view, but the extravagant Idiotry which the passions of Love, Disdain, Joy, Resentment, would on a real occasion actuate on the personages they represent: Nor do they so manage their Dance that it is ungraceful: they take opportunities to show by actions and movements, that in their comic Humour they have an elegancy.  This performance therefore, on Reflection, appear'd to me, instead of an unnatural extravaganza to be founded on the nicest Observations of Human Nature, and prove Signor and Signora to be persons of good judgment, as well as agility.

Mrs Clive paused a little and then answered, Madam, I have a reputation to lose.  Madam, said Mrs Woffington, so should I have too if I had your face.

Many of the Persons concerned in the late struggle with the Manager, might have been left destitute had I deserted them, therefore I thought it incumbent on me to endeavor at this reconciliation with my own, upon reasonable terms; this I have accomplish'd, and hope I am excusable for not playing 'til it is determin'd.  Tho I am sensible my affairs are too inconsiderable to be laid before the Publick, yet as I am their servants, and have been so much favour'd with their Indulgence, I thought it my Duty to convince 'em that it is neither Obstinacy, or Exorbitancy, but a quite different motive, that detains me so long from doing my utmost to contribtte to their Entertainment.

The following Letter, signed A By-Stander was inserted in the +London Daily Post and General Advertiser=: As I am absolutely unconcerned in all the now subsiding Theatrical Disputes, I hope the following observations upon what happened last Tuesday Night at +Drury Lane= will not be thought unworthy the Publick attention.  The Manager of a theatre is to regard the General sense of the Town, and not any Faction form'd thru pique or resentment; Such a Faction may be Noisy, it may be Insolent, but never can be Considerable enough to force either the Manager or the Publick into their terms.  Their outrages are equally insults upon the Understanding of the Town, as they are injuries to the Property of the Manager.  Therefore if the Manager shall at any time give way to such proceedings, Then and not till Then, the Publick has a right ot find fault with him.  The stage Then becomes a property to the insolence of a few misled people; and all theatrical diversions, which in this and other countries used to be directed by Decency and Publick Approbation are sacrificed to a pitiful Personal Resentment.  If the above propositions are undeniable, the following Queries are submitted to the Publick, and the answer to them will determine the Reasonableness of the Tuesday Night Riot: I. Whether the Rioters were not Inconsiderable in their numbers and Circumstances?  II: Whether any Gentleman can answer to himself, for doing in a Body, a thing which no Gentleman can justify for doing by himself?  III. Whether the Rioters can justify their breaking into the Boxes, and taking possession of the seats, which were taken by many persons of Quality and Distinction, at the same time refusing to pay anything; thereby robbing the Manager of all the money of the Boxes, and most part of the Pit?  IV. Whether the Manager ought to suffer in his property for the private quarrel between any two actors, as was the case...?  V: Whether if such insolences are not discountenanced in the most effectual manner by the Town, any publick diversion can continue longer than a noisy inconsiderable Cabal pleases?  VI. Whether any other motive than a regard to Public Decency would have hindered the Manager and Mr. Garrick's friends (who were treble the number) from treating the rioters as they deserved?  I should be glad to see the above questions fairly and impartially answered.  *phcg Julius Caesar; with The Deaths of Brutus and Cassius.

Last night the Play of the +Rehearsal= was perform'd at the Theatre Royal in +Drury Lane=; when, upon $Mr Garrick='s making a proper apology to the Town he was receiv'd with the greatest marks of Approbation; and the Play was acted with the utmost Decency and Order.  *picg Aesop.

To the Author of the +General Advertiser=: It is with great Pleasure I find by the Publick Papers that a tragedy founded on $Voltaire='s +Mahomet= is now in rehearsal at +Drury Lane Theatre=.  The Original was by Authority forbid to be played in +France= on account of the free and noble sentiments with regard to Bigotry and Enthusiasm, which shine through it; and which that Nation found as applicable to itself, as to the bloody propagators of $Mahomet='s Religion.  Indeed the Fable on which it is built demanded such sentiments; the design of it being to shew the dreadful effects of Bigotry and Enthusiasm, even upon minds naturally well inclined when work'd up to such a pitch, as a beautiful concurrence of amazing, yet probable Circumstances hath there carried them to: So that it was equally impossible for the poet, by cutting and mangling his play, to lop it to their standard of +Orthodox poetry=, as it were for their Inquisitors, by torturing and burning a poor +Protestant=, to convince him of their +Christian love and charity=....They foresaw that the most obvious Reflection, that every sensible Spectator could not but make, would be, that he every day saw the same effects produced from two the most different causes, +Mahometanism= and +Christianity=; and the consequence must be, either that they were both alike Imposters, or that a crafty, mercenary, and cruel Clergy had dared to add a spirit to Christianity, which Christianity never knew.  It is not doubted but these every Sentiments, which in France, prevented the Representation of this piece, will, in +England= speak loudly in its favor (providdd our +English poet= is not unequal to his subject) especially since so audacious an attempt has been lately made by the Common Enemy of +Europe= to establish at once a Civil and Spiritual Tyranny over those injur'd Nations, by the old Mohametan and +Roman Arguments of Fire and Sword=.

Whereas the contrary does most manifestly appear, in many instances as well from the accounts or advertisements we read in the daily Papers, printed and dispersed within the County (inviting and seducing, not only the inhabitants, but also all other persons, to several places kept apart for the encouragement of Luxury, Extravagance, and Idleness, and we fear other wicked, illegal purposes, which by such means go on with impunity, to the destruction of many families) as otherwise to the great Dishonour of the Kingdom...especially at a time when we are engaged in expensive Wars, and so much overburdened with Taxes of all sorts, both Parliamentary and Parochial, that it is much as a prudent man can do, without a taste to extravagant and illegal pleasure to support himself and family according to his degree and station in life under the most regular economy.  [If unchecked this bad example will lead to National destruction].  We do accordingly hereby present as places riotous, of great extravagance, luxury, idleness, and ill fame, the several house &c following: [lists two gambling houses, then the Proprietors of the avenues leading to the several playhouses for not preventing wicked loose and disorderly persons from loitering at the front of their several houses on nights of the play to the prejudice of playgoers.]  4. +Saddlers Wells=, near +Islington=; 5.
