and the Scene changes to The Town and Fortifications of Mycoene.  Hercules at th
e head of his Army summons it to surrender--the Prince brings Omphale on the Bat
tlements bound in Chains-The Battering Ram and all the Implements of War are bro
ught in Action against the City--the Besieged defend themselves by hurling huge

 *c"On 28th March 1795, I saw the Opera +Aci & Galathea= by $Bianchi=.  The musi
c is very rich in parts for the wind instruments, and I rather think one would h
ear the principal melody better if it were not so richly scored.  The Opera is t
oo long, especially since $Banti= has to keep everything going all by herself; f
or $Brida= is a good youngster with a beautiful voice but very little musical fe
eling; and $Rovedino=, and the good old $Braghetti=, and the wretched +Seconda D
onna=-they all deserved, and received, not the least applause.  The orchestra is
 larger this year, but just as mechanical and badly placed as it was before, and
 indiscreet in its accompaniments; in short, it was the 3rd time that this Opera
 was performed, and everyone was dissatisfied.  It happened that, when the 2nd B
allet began, the whole public suddenly became dissatisfied and yelled 'off-off-o
ff,' because they wanted to see the new Ballet which $Madam Hilligsberg= had giv
en at her +Benefice= 2 days earlier.  Everyone was embarrassed-there was an inte
rval lasting half an hour-until at last a dancer came forward and said, very sub
missively: 'Ladies and Gentlemen: since the performer [sic, instead of proprieto
r] $Mr Taylor= cannot be found, the whole Ballet Company promises to perform the
 desired ballet next week, for which, however, the Impresario must pay Madam Hil
ligsberg #300.'That satisfied them, and they then yelled, 'go on-go on;' and thu
s the old Ballet was performed' ($Haydn=, 293).  *p30[-4 Apr.% none Holy Week.

had in the Theatre.  [When Colman published his play he prefaced it with an acri
monious attack on $Kemble=, in which he accused him of deliberately trying to ma
ke the play a failure.  But almost without exception the contemporary reviews ex
cused Kemble's performance on the grounds of his obvious indisposition, and agre
ed that the play itself was unsatisfactory.  "The play failed, and we are sorry 
to say did not merit to succeed...Kemble, who was tormented With an incessant co
ugh, said he could not but be sensible that much of the displeasure of the house
 proceeded from his deficiency in a principal character...The whole audience wit
h one voice cried out, 'No, no, Kemble-it is not your fault'" (Oracle, 14 Mar.).
  "The dialogue is extremely heavy, and there is little or no incident to reliev
e the tedium of more than four hours representation...+Sir Edward Mortimer=r is 
a being distracted, with no adequate cause; a prey to remorse, which he of all m
en was the last to feel from the principles that make up his being. This therefo
re is the radical moral defect of the piece.  But there is another which, though
 not equally strong, is equally fatal: there is no progression of interest, ther
e is no involution of plot, there is no development of character" (+Star=, 14 Ma
r.).  Other notices of the opening night were much in the same vein.  Subsequent
ly Colman revised the play, and it held the stage for many years.  "The curtailm
ents which have been made shorten the representation near an hour and a half, an
d the alterations are many and judicious" (Morning Herald, 21 Mar. 1796).  Morni

 evidently intended to injure the interest of the Proprietor of the MSS., $Mr Sa
muel? Ireland= [W. H. Ireland's father] feels it impossible, within the short sp
ace of time that intervenes between the publishing and the representation, to pr
oduce an answer to the most illiberal and unfounded assertions in Mr Malone's en
quiry [i.e. $Edmond Malone=, +An Inquiry into the Authenticity of certain Papers
 attributed to Shakspeare, Queen Elizabeth, and Henry, Earl of Southampton=, 179
6].  He is therefore induced to request that Vortigern may be heard With that Ca
ndour that has ever distinguished a British Audience.  The Play is now at the Pr
ess, and will in a very few days be laid before the Public.  [But it was not iss
ued until 1799 (see below).  See also $Bernard Grebanier=, +The Great Shakespear
e Forgery=, +London=, 1966.]  *c+Oracle=, 4 Apr., states that the first three ac
ts were listened to with patience, but beginning with the fourth act the play wa
s damned, when "one tremendous yell of indignation from the pit burst simultaneo
usly."  "At four o'clock the doors of the theatre were besieged; and, a few minu
tes after they were opened, the pit was crowded solely with gentlemen.  Before s
ix not a place was to be found in the boxes, and the passages were filled...The 
audience betrayed symptoms of impatience early in the representation; but, findi
ng its taste insulted by bloated terms, which heightened the general insipidity,
 its reason puzzled by discordant images, false ornaments, and abortive efforts 
to elevate and astonish, pronounced its sentence of condemnation at the conclusi
on of the play" (+Gentleman's Magazine=, Apr. 1795, pp. 346-47).  "Irelands play
 of Vortigern I went to.  Prologue spoken at 35 minutes past 6 [see 29 Mar.]: Pl
ay over at 10.  A strong party was evidently made to support it, which clapped w
ithout opposition frequently through near 3 acts, when some ridiculous passages 
caused a laugh, mixed with groans-Kemble requested the audience t  o hear the pl
ay out abt. the end of 4th act and prevailed.-The Epilogue was spoken by $Mrs Jo
rdan= who skipped over some lines which claimed the play as Shakespeares.  $Barr
ymore= attempted to give the Play out for Monday next but was hooted off the sta
ge.  Kemble then came on, & after some time, was permitted to say that "+School 
for Scandal= would be given," which the House approved by clapping.  $Sturt= of 
+Dorsetshire= was in a Stage Box drunk, & exposed himself indecently to support 
the Play, and when one of the stage attendants attempted to take up the green cl
oth [i.e. a carpet which, by custom, was laid on the stage during the concluding
