at has been incurred in re-building this Theatre (in the erecting of which no ot
her Object has been attempted but the greater ease, safety and accomodation of t
he Spectators) it appears upon the Books that the Annual Disbursements of the pa
st Seasons have gradually been encreasing from Year to Year, under the Direction
 of the present Proprietor, to nearly the sum of #10,000 per Annum more than the
 usual Expenditure of any of his Predecessors; it is therefore trusted the Neces
sity of the following small Advancement of the Prices of Admission to the Boxes 
and the Pit will be sufficiently apparent to the Justice of that Public whose Li
berality has never yet been doubted.  $E. Barlow=, Treasurer.  Boxes 6s. 2nd Pri

 "The Prelude passed off without a syllable of it being heard...Two acts of +The

h great propriety of tone, emphasis, or gesture, than others.  But she has of th
ese, certain peculiarities, which indicate dispositions, such as take strong hol
d of the affections, at least of the male part of her audience; and therefore, w
hen the part is of a sort to admit a large portion of these, she produces a grea
t effect.  The true acting of the part may, in many instances, not require what 
she throws into it, but it may admit it; and if the expression so thrown in is o
f the sort described, the effect of the whole will be improved, though the part 
is thereby neither better nor worse acted" (+Windham Diary=, 28 May 1791, 227).

=, June 1791, p. 438: On Saturday night, of a gradual decay, and in the 117th ye
ar of her age, died old Madam Drury, who lived through six reigns, and saw many 
generations pass in review before her...She had a rout of near 2000 people at he
r house the very night of her death; and the old lady found herself in so much s
pirits, that she said she would give them 'No Supper' without a 'Song'; which be
ing complied with, she fell back gently in her chair, and expired without a groa
n.  $Dr Palmer=, one of her family physicians, attended her in her last moments,
 and announced her dissolution to the company.  [This was written by $George Col
man, ynger=.]  +Gazetteer=, 6 June: $Samuel Johnson= was powerfully and pathetic
ally shewn the universal horror which men feel of the last even towards things i
ndifferent, or sometimes unpleasant; and there seemed to be some apprehension of
 this sort of pain on Saturday, for a very few attended to take their leave of t
he scene where they have been so often regaled with fictitious sorrow and gladne
ss.  [This theatre was first opened on 26 March 1674.  It has been altered and r
edecorated on several occasions, notably by the architects $Robert and James Ada
m= in the summer of 1775, for which see illustration in +The London Stage=, Part
 IV, Vol. III, 1650.  The new theatre was not in readiness until April, 1794.  T
he principal reason for the delay was that the patent had lapsed, and "it being 
necessary to obtain one previous to the payment of their respective sums on the 
part of the subscribers, application was made to $Mr Harris=, of +Covent Garden 
Theatre=, who possessed a dormant patent."  The price set was #15,000, and the p
atent was sent to a banker for inspection.  A $Mr George White=, who had married
 a daughter of $William Powell=, one of the former patentees, and had thereby a 
financial interest, objected to this price, and "obtained a prohibition in the $
Court of Chancery= which obliged the banker to restore the patent to the Manager
 of Covent Garden Theatre."  The subscribers to the new +Drury Lane= thereupon r
efused to pay their subscriptions, and work on the demolition of the old theatre
 was halted (+London Chronicle=, 30 July 1792).  Sheridan finally offered #20,00
0: #15,000 to Harris and #5,000 to White, which was accepted, and work on the th
eatre was resumed, the cornerstone being laid on 4 Sept. 1792 (+Morning Chronicl
e=, 6 Sept.; +London Chronicle=, 12 Sept. 1792).  The Actual sum eventually paid
 to Harris was #11,667.]  Paid in lieu of Benefits: $Kelly= #100; $Miss Farren=
