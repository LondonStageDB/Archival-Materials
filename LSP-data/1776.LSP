imself from the Management of the Theatre--accordingly at eight this Evening he 
sent me with a Letter to Lacy confirming what he told him, and ordered me to rec
eive my orders from Mr L  and that he withdrew the Christmas Tale, as he had alt

 $Mrs Abington= to know if she would play in the Hypocrite, as it was advertised

t $Mr Lacy= and he had agreed that no Play should be given out, nor any Bills pu
t up, till they had settled this Affair, which was to be done to-Morrow at $Mr W
allis='s (the Attorney's) where they were all to dine.  I waited on Mr Lacy, who
 agreed to the same, and no Bills or Paragraph were sent to the Papers.  All the
 Business of the Theatre is at a Stand, and no Rehearsal called.  Wed. 16th--Mr 
Sheridan, $Dr Ford= and $Mr Linley= dined today by Appointment with Mr Wallis wh
ere Mr Lacy was to have met them; about four o'clock he sent a verbal Message th
at he could not come to Dinner, but would wait upon them in the Evening, and abo
ut nine o'clock he came, and everything was settled to the Satisfaction (of them
 all) and a Paragraph sent to the Papers, and the +Hypocrite= and +Christmas Tal
e= was advertised for Friday, but no Play was to be done on Thursday--+Covent Ga
rden= did not play on Friday (Hopkins Diary).  +Public Advertiser=, 16 Oct., sum
marizes the proprietors' dispute: the +Drury Lane= patent had been purchased [in
 1747] by $David Garrick= and $James Lacy=.  On his death Lacy had devised his h
alf-share to his son, $Willoughby Lacy=; on his retirement from the stage Garric
k had sold his half-share to Sheridan, Ford and Linley.  The original agreement 
between Garrick and Lacy, as recited in a document retained by the attorney $Alb
any Wallis= was that, in case of the sale of either share of the patent, or any 
part of either share, the seller was obligated to offer the first refusal to pur
chase to the other partner, and that this was to be done only when the theatre w
as closed for the summer.  In selling one half of his share to $Robert Langford=
 and to $Edward Thompson=, Willoughby Lacy was--so argued his three partners--ac
ting illegally: he had not offered to them the first refusal, and he was negotia
ting the sale at a time when the theatre was open.  +Public Advertiser=, 17 Oct.
. prints a statement from Lacy saying that he did not feel himself bound by the 
original agreement between his father and Garrick, but that, in the interest of 
the business of the theatre, he had asked Langford and Thompson to withdraw thei
r claim to partnership, to which request they had acceded.  Receipts: #130 9s. 6

"This play was written by Mr Henry Fielding, some years before his death.  Mr Ga
rrick saw it at that time.  Mr Fielding gave the only fair copy he had of it to 
his friend $Sir Charles Williams=, of whose judgment he entertained a high opini
on.  Sir Charles soon after went abroad, and the comedy was mislaid.  Mr. Fieldi
ng communicated this circumstance to his family on his death-bed; and enquiry wa
s made for it, but without effect.  At length $Mr Thomas? Johnes=, Member for +C
ardigan=, looking over Sir Charles's books, found a comedy in manuscript, which 
he read, and, approving, had it transcribed and sent to Mr Garrick for his opini
on, who, like $Archimedes=, cried out, 'This is the lost sheep!  This is Mr Henr
y Fielding's play!'  Mr Garrick communicating it to Mr Johnes, Mr Johnes immedia
tely sent the original manuscript, which was in Mr Fielding's hand-writing, to t
he family, with his best wishes for its success, promising to assist it to the u
tmost of his power" (+Gentleman's Magazine=, Dec. 1778, p.586).  See also, for c

Tickets to be had of Reddish, No. 14, near the +Turnpike=, +Tottenham Court Road
=.  "Poor Reddish, on the 5th of May, had a benefit, and it was resolved to try 
whether he could not go through the character of +Posthumus=r.  He was now infir
m; in common occurrences imbecile, but to be exited by his former profession, or
 nothing.  The late $John Ireland= gave an affecting detail of this attempt.  He
 met his friend an hour before the performance began.  Reddish entered the room 
with the step of an idiot, his eye wandering, and his whole countenance vacant. 
 Mr Ireland congratulated him, that he was sufficiently recovered to perform his
 favourite Posthumus.  'Yes', said he, 'and in the garden scene I shall astonish
 you.'  'The garden scene!  I thought you were to play Posthumus?'  'No, Sir, I 
play +Romeo=r.'  His friend assured him that Posthumus was the part he was to ac
t--and he walked to the theatre, reciting Romeo all the way.  When dressed for P
osthumus, and in the green-room, it was still hard to undeceive him--at length h
e was pushed upon the stage....The instant he came in sight of the audience his 
recollection seemed to return; his countenance resumed meaning, his eye became l
ighted up, he made the modest bow of respect, and played the scene as well as he
 had ever done.  But Romeo again met him in the green-room, and it was only the 
stage cue that had the power to unsettle this delusion; and that never failed to
 do it through the whole play.  Mr Ireland thought him, on this occasion, less a
ssuming and more natural than he had seemed in the full enjoyment of his reason"
