mond, discovered at his studies, is interrupted by the entrance of Don Felix (hi
s father), who informs him 'tis his wish he should go upon his travels; Theodore
, his favorite domestic, intreats to accompany him.  II. +Madrid; with a View of
 an Hotel and a Convent=v.  Procession of Nuns and Friars.  Chorus.  Agnes, the 
daughter of Count Lindenbergh, discovered at the lattice.  Raymond and Theodore 
enter, order refreshments from the Hotel, and proceed on their journey, under th
e guidance of Claud, one of a banditti infesting the neighbouring Forest.  III. 
+A Forest at Midnight, with a distant Hovel=v.  Enter Baptist (one of the Bandit
ti) disguised as a woodman.  The carriage with Raymond and Theodore is seen to b
reak down.  Claud, pointing to the Hovel, informs them they may there find shelt
er for the night.  IV. +The Inside of the Hovel=v.  Maugerette and her Child dis
covered.  Raymond and Theodore are introduced by Baptist.  Theodore is shewn to 
his room by Maugerette.  Robert and Jaques (sons to Baptist) enter armed, making
 a servile obedience to Raymond, who is conducted to his chamber by Robert.  V. 
+The Bed-room prepared for Raymond=v.  Maugerette wishing to preserve the life o
f Raymond from the assassins, conveys a Pillow stained with blood upon his bed, 
thereby to inform him of his danger.  She conceals herself.  Raymond retires to 
rest, but is prevented by finding the bloody Pillow, and struck with horror, fal
ls into a swoon.  Robert enters, attempts to murder him, is prevented by Maugere
tte; and Raymond, at her request, retires.  VI. +The Lower Apartment of the Hove
l=v.  Robert informs his father and brother of the ineffectual attempt on the li
fe of Raymond, who is brought in by Maugerette.  A knocking is heard without.  A
gnes (who has been also benighted in the forest) is led in by Claud, attended by
 Servants.  Supper is prepared.  Opiates are mixed with the wine.  Agnes drinks,
 and falls into a slumber.  Maugerette begs Raymond not to drink, but to put on 
the semblance of sleep.  Baptist sends Robert and Jaques to secure the servants,
 who have retired; and supposing Raymond at rest, prepares to murder him.  Raymo
nd seizes him, and Baptist falls by the hand of Maugerette, who points out a sec
ret avenue, through which she, taking her child, Raymond and Agnes escape, follo
wed by Theodore.  VII. +Inside of Lindenbergh Castle=v.  The mother of Agnes, th
e late Countess, pourtrayed in the habit of a Nun.  The Count discovered viewing
 the picture with agitation; kneels to implore forgiveness for the Murder.  Agne
s brought in by Raymond, is introduced to the present Countess.  She becomes ena
moured of him, offers him her Picture, which he rejects with scorn.  VIII. +The 
Chamber of Agnes=v.  Portrait of a Nun, with a wound upon her breast, a Lamp, Da
gger, and a Rosary on her arm.  Agnes enamoured of Raymond, enters, and prepares
 to draw his Portrait.  Raymond entering unperceived, throws himself at her feet
, and obtains a promise of her hand.  He requests an explanation of the picture 
of the bleeding Nun.  She informs him (in a Song) 'tis the resemblance of a Spec
tre which haunts the Castle every fifth year.  The Count and Countess approach; 
and in anger order Raymond to quit the castle.  IX. +The Outside of the Castle=v
.  Raymond, about to depart, is diverted by the sound of a Mandoline.  A paper i
s lowered by Agnes from the Castle, containing a drawing of the Nun, with the fo
llowing Scrole: "When the castle-bell tolls One.  Expect me like this bleeding N
un."  X. +The Outside of the Castle, as before=v.  Raymond descends the Wall; th
e Clock strikes One; the Gates fly open; the apparition of the Nun comes from th
e Castle.  Raymond (supposing it Agnes) follows in extasy.  Theodore approaching
 is met by Agnes in the habit of the Nun.  Agitated by the apparent neglect of R
aymond, they retire.  XI. +A Dreary Wood=v.  Raymond, following the spectre (sti
ll supposing it Agnes), attempts to embrace it, when suddenly vanishing, a Cloud
 rises from the earth bearing the following inscription: "Protect the Child of t
he Murder'd Agnes."  XII. +The Mountains=v.  Robert, Jaques and Claud (the Robbe
rs) discovered at the grave of Baptist.  Theodore and Agnes enter.  Agnes is sei
zed and borne into the Cavern.  XIII.  +A Wood=v.  Theodore and Maugerette meet 
Raymond, and inform him of Agnes being seized by the Robbers.  They hasten to he
r rescue.  XIV. +Inside of the Cavern=v.  The three Robbers cast lots for the po
ssession of Agnes.  She becomes the prize of Robert.  He attempts to seize her. 
 She resisting, he aims a stiletto at her breast.  At this instant Raymond, Theo
dore and Maugerette rush in.  Robert falls by the dagger of Raymond, Jaques by t
he sword of Theodore, and Claud by a pistol from the hand of Maugerette.  XV. +T

hands; and the Piece concludes with a%Finale and Spanish Fandango-.  *sAfterpiec

dition to the character springing from himself.  It might be called an attempt t
o take advantage of the lingering sparks of gallantry in the aunt, or the mother
 of sixty, or the ancient maiden whom he had to win, to carry the purposes of th

guard, until at length his whole artillery of assault was applied to storm the s
truggling resistance; and the $Mattockses= and the $Davenports= of his attention
s sometimes complained of the perpetual motion of his chair, which compelled the

+Blanche=r reside; this is granted, and they scarcely retire, before the conquer
ing party rush into the Inn, but are prevented from using outrage by the interve
ntion of a young English General (+Talbot=r) of whom the sisters become enamoure
d.  He prefers Blanche; and Joan, from resentment, in conjunction with Alenson, 
meditate his ruin, in which they fail, and are forced to fly--Joan grown despera
te, invokes supernatural aid, and receives a Banner from +Lucifer=r--distinguish
es the French King in the midst of his Courtiers, tho' a Nobleman in his habit h
ad been imposed on her for him--demands a consecrated sword and shield at the to
mb of Charlemagne--heads the French troops, and being victorious, takes young Ta
lbot and her sister (whom he had espoused) Prisoners.  +Edwin=r (young Talbot's 
Page), not allowed to attend on his master, by concealing himself in the spoils 
of his tent is conveyed to the court-yard of his Prison, thro' the grating of wh
ich he gives him a sleeping draught, telling him on drinking it that they will s
uppose him dead, and the English demand his body.  He complies, but the request 
of the English is refused, and he lowered into the Cell where Blanche is confine
d--She conceives him dead--despairing, is on the point of destroying herself, wh
en he awakes--the Page from the top of the Cell points out the means of escape, 
which they are accomplishing, when Joan rushes in, but appalled at the ghost-lik
e appearance of Talbot, whom she conceived dead, permits them to glide by, but p
ursues them--excursions with the enemy--Joan kills Talbot's Father, and forces h
im to combat-disdaining the threats of a woman, he throws away his sword, acting
 only on the defensive--disarms her--she rushes on him, when her supernatural po
wer failing, her sword and shield break to pieces-she snatches her banner, which
 takes fire--grown desperate, seizes a sword and attempts to stab him, is preven
ted by British soldiers who surround and vanquish her--Young Talbot at the same 
time killing Alenson--her life is preserved by the intercession of Blanche--the 
British are victorious, she rushes off, again solicits supernatural aid--is surr

 by Act of +Parliament=, 1776.  This Institution, calculated to provide for, and
 relieve aged and infirm Performers and their Families, has not been successful 
enough during the course of 33 years, to acquire any particular Patronage, but h
as been raised and supported (some few private Donations and Bequests excepted) 
merely through the liberal Contributions of its Members.  Several aged Persons a
re now, and have been for many years, oeconomically maintained by it, although t
he Interest arising from the general Sum already amassed is not equal to one hal
f of the Claims of its Annuitants.  The other Portion is entirely supplied from 
the weekly Contributions of the Performers.  Applications to the Public in behal
f of this salutary Institution have rarely been made, and sometimes very ineffec
tually.  On these Considerations therefore the Lovers of Dramatic Entertainments
 are respectfully addressed for their Encouragement at This Evening's Performanc

f Mr King, backed by a strong assurance from many admirers and encouragers of th

Town, has kindly consented to return to the Theatre for one night, and resume hi
s favourite Character.  "We had been told that $Smith= pourtrayed the Manners of
 a finished gentleman with more delicacy and characteristic propriety than any a
ctor of his day; but this did not appear to us to be his particular excellence; 
he stands too wide to be graceful, and his deportment gains no advantage from a 
perpetual application of his hand to the lower part of the waist.  These habits 
are far from elegant.  His Charles, however, is a favourable specimen of that so
rt of acting which commonly falls under the denomination of the old school: ligh
t, airy, and natural; which excites applause without any anxious endeavour to pr
oduce it; which suffers the points to tell of themselves, and does not place the
m as so many traps to ensnare the injudicious part of the audience" (+Monthly Mi
rror=, May 1798, p. 299).  "He was received with the most heart-felt gratulation
s by an audience who did not expect any apology for such acting, though he saw f
it to deliver one at the conclusion of the play" (+Monthly Visitor=, May 1798, p
