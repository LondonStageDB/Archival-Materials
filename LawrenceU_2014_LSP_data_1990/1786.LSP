ht of this theatre, which had been built by and was under the management of $Joh

 of the proprietors of +dl=, +cg= and +hay= to his opening the theatre.  He said
 that he had from the Lieutenant of the $Tower of London= what he considered to 
be sufficient permission, but that he would nevertheless close the theatre tempo
rarily.  Palmer's difficulty was that he had no really legal permission from any
body for the performance of actual plays.  See 3 July, and for further details t
he head-note to this season.  +World=, 18 July, prints an official accoudting fo

resting is the +bridge Rialto=v, and this is badly executed; it looks like a pan
tomimic show, but not like a grand opera scene; the bridge is crowded with figur
ative passengers, and small gondolas appear beyond it.  The first idea is a capi
tal error, for the representation of the bridge is supposed sideways, and being 
covered with shops, no passengers can be seen; the latter idea of boats being pl
aced beyond the bridge crowds the scene, and makes the bridge lose its grand app
earance at a distance...The Managers of the Opera are exceedingly to blame for h
aving substituted a Soprano to a Tenor in the character of +Gafforio=r" (+Public

mayed, but continued their evolutions, though the noise was so great that they d
erived but little aid from the music.  At last a body of malcontents, among whom
 were several stars and ribbons, sallied from the pit and took possession of the
 stage, from which they drove the light-heeled troops, and immediately began to 
perform a ballet tragique.  The chamber of +Ifigenia=r was despoiled of all its 
ornaments, and side scenes, and patent lamps; Roman tents and triumphal cars dan
ced on the stage in all the mazes of confusion, nor did they cease, till they ha
