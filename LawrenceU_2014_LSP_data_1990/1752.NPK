At this the town was offened, and a party went one evening determind to damn it; a person of some distinction [$Fitzpatrick=] who was very busy in this laudable attempt threw an apple at $Woodward= and hit him.  Woodward resented the blow by some words, which, by the gentleman's account, implied a challenge, but by Woodward's no such thing.

In it Booth forgives Young for withdrawing the play from rehearsal thirty years earlier, and thus precluding his playing the part of Demetrius: "And I the more readily pardon you, as you have not disgraced me by giving the part to any of my successors, till this $Garrick= appeared, whose reputation, I can assure you, is by no means confined to your world, and who, I am told, hath more than supply'd my place, hath rendered the loss even of $Betterton= himself very supportable."

A number of Cats, clothed uniformly, were placed on stools, with music books before them, and a Monkey in the middle who beat time.  On a signal given by the Monkey, the cast set up a mewing, and were accompanied by some violins; which form'd a very diverting dissonance.

Criticizes a supposed rival for planting herself full against her,  as if with an intent by the superior force of her effrontery to stare away the little degree of Courage" $Miss Nossiter= had left.  Her youth and freshness required no paint, so her color came and went as the passion required it, no small addition to the impression of natural acting.  She is never inattentive on stage.  She feels what others say as much as what she speaks herself.  The Author gives practically a speech by speech account of her part, describing her gesture, action, and modulation of voice minutely.  Concludes by pointing the reader's attention to $Otway='s contribution to the $Garrick= version which was played then at both houses.  Praises $Barry= for instructing Miss Nossiter and bringing her to the stage.  Hopes Garrick will refrain from attacking her in his papers, +The Craftsman= and +Gray's Inn Journal=, because she will one day become  such an ornament to the stage, that I shall be proud to own myself the first who publicly displayed her merit.'  Hers is  the greatest real first attempt made by man or Woman on the stage, within these 40 years."  See also 1 Nov.]  *pé?dl The Fair Penitent.

That no player shall come on imperfect in his part, or take liberties to insert his own jokes and witticisms in the Productions of those Geniuses, for whom he should have the proper respect due to the superiority of their parts.  III.  That no one shall mistake bawling for Expression; strutting and swaggering for deportment; twisting the body and looking cunning for sprightliness; pinching of hats and standing on tiptoe for graceful attitude; wry faces for Humour, &c., but that each player who cannot arrive at excellence, shall at least pay some regard to decency.

Her voice has strength and scope sufficient; has neither too much of the feminine, nor an inclining to the male.  Her gestures are ever varying; her transitions quick and easy.  Some over-nice critics, forgetting, or not knowing the meaning of the word Burletta, cry that her manner is outre.  Wou'd she not be faulty were it otherwise?  The thing chargeable to her is (perhaps) too great a luxurience of comic tricks; which (an austere censor would say) border on unlaced lasciviousness, and extravagant petulance of action ($Paul Hiffernan=, +The Tuner=, No 1).

Author's thesis: "A master of theatrical expression in all its extensive significancy must be possess'd of such accomplishments, as to set the profession above all contempt."  $Garrick= is mentioned as best example.  True tragic expression "requires Genius, Education, Reading, Experience...and a solidity of thought which never accompanies abject morals" (p. 11).  Includes an interesting treatise on acting-sections on figure, voice, ear, memory, management of feet and legs.  Comments on costume: "Taste in dress demands that an actor be conversant in the mode of dress ancient and modern, in other countries as well as in our own...$Alexander= and $Cato= were not masters of the snuff box, nor +Greek women= of +French heels=."  The appendix asks why all our plays are not dressed in character in point of time and place, and why they do not contain at least one "scene" proper to the country.  The author (p. 61) sees need for variety in acting same role, especially when a play has a continuous run of several nights.  He calls (p. 77) for creation of appropriate mood for the play by selection of proper music between the acts.  Wants a softening of the prompter's bell.  Concludes by damning contemporary audience manners, especially those of the stage loungers (pp. 79-81).]  Receipts: #314 ($Cross=).  *pêMcg Appius.

[$Mrs Frances Brooke=, in +The Old Maid=, for 8 May 1756, gives the following eye-witness account of the evening: "I determined to watch the artless working of [the Ambassador's] surprise, and to catch, as well as I could his sentiments of the theatre, the Audience, the Play, and the performers.  And shall give them to my readers, just as they appeared to me.  On his first coming to the front of the Box, he was complimented with the Applause of the whole House, which seemed to give him great pleasure, and which he returned by two bows in the +English=, and afterwards by a reverence in the +Moorish manner=, which last I thought very graceful...tho' he is rather low of stature, yet his loose flowing robes, and his manner altogether gave him such an air of superiority, that I thought the Audience looked only like his attendants.  "The House and Spectators attracted his notice so much for some time, that he seem'd very well entertained before the drawing up of the curtain.  At the first scene between the Lords, I thought he looked disappointed, and after a transient view of the stage, directed his eyes again to the company; at the entrance of +King Henry=r his attention was a little recover'd to the performance, but his majesty had not proceeded half way thru the scene, before he burst into a most immoderate fit, of apparently contemptuous laughter, which he repeated very often thro' the whole playing of the part.  The manner in which this stranger was affected by it, amongst other considerations, fully convinces me that this character is most ridiculously burlesqued in the representation, and that both $Shakespeare= and the Monarch are very inhumanly sacrificed, to the polite taste, and elegant distinction of the upper gallery....I could point out many abuses of the like nature, which have increased upon us so much of late, that 'tis almost impossible to attend the theatres, with the expectation of receiving pleasure from some parts of the perfbrmance, without the certainty of suffering equal disgust from others; it was the case of many besides myself, at this of Henry, upon the absurdity of +Winchester=r's brandishing his cane at +Canterbury=r, upon the close of the Council Scene; and yet to give opportunity for this notable stage foolery, the Archbishop and Bishop are both made to walk out of their proper order, tho' in attendance upon the King....His character is drawn by Shakespeare very nearly as it stands in history, and in colours far different from the farcical ones, in which it is the present fashion to represent it.  He is described indeed as imperious, but at the same time a great Monarch, and not withstanding his short interjections of anger, he is in my judgment upon every occasion a King.  I wish this consideration may prevail with $Mr Berry=, when he plays this character for the future, to remember that tho' +Harry=r as well as +Jobson=r may be something rough and boistrous, yet the turbulency of a haughty prince, is a very different quality, and must therefore appear in avery different fashion, from the sawciness of an impudent cobbler.  "Whatever neglect his Moorish Excellency might discover of this part, he paid great attention to that of +Queen Catherine=r; but nothing seem'd to affect him so stronglyas $Miss Young='s singing, at which he appeared quite collected, and listened to her with all marks of rapturous admiration; his whole soul appeared touched, and at the end of the song, he joined the house in clapping, a mark of applause I did not observe him give at any other time.  "I thought upon the King's kissing +Anna Bullen=r, that he appeared surprized and offended, and looked about, to observe whether others were not affected in the same manner.  "The procession was less marked by him than I had expected, but upon the +Champion=r's entry on horseback, he burst into such an Immoderate fit of laughter, as to fall quite back in his seat.  "At the end of the play he rose, as if to leave the House, but looked very well pleased upon being informed there was more entertainment to come; in the Pantomime he seem'd surprized and disgusted at the appearance of +Harlequin=r, to whom he did not appear reconciled to the last; his wonder was still greater at the flying of the +Genii=r cross the stage, and other parts of the machinery, which I thought he studied byt was puzzled to account for.  He laughed heartily at the +Clown=r, and admired +Colombine=r not a little....  "I am jealous of the honour of my country in all respects.  I would have this stranger leave it with as high opinion of our publick entertainments as possible, and could wish that at the Old House, he might see $Mr Garrick= in +Richard=r or some equally striking part, and at the New, he may be present at plays, where rich dresses, magnificent show and graceful action, and uncommon personal perfections in the principal performers might contribute to give him a more elevated idea of our stage, than he can have receiv'd from +King Harry=."]  Receipts: #210 ($Cross=).  *pícg Love for Love.

"Sir: Perhaps there never was a period when the members of the stage were more respected than at present; and this favour consequently proceeds from the decency of their behaviour, and an emulative pride to please that public, whose generosity is an ample reward for their assiduity and perseverance; and when we consider the many qualifications, as well natural as acquired, requisite to constitute a player, surely the most rigid judge will be of opinion that the encouragement is not more than equal to the excellence.  An actor must feel, that is, have the most refined idea of his part, to make an audience feel likewise; and adequate to the pleasures he enjoys in the applause of his approvers, will rise his degree of unhappiness, if by accident or sickness he is obstructed in the execution of his Genius; and should this happen at the era of his benefit, it must then be his misfortune to supplicate that interest which otherwise his merit would have commanded.  "I was led to these reflections by accidentally perusing an advertisement prefix'd to a bill for the benefit of $Mr Lowe=; a performer too well known to need encomiums here; from whom the Town receive no inconsiderable Satisfaction at the theatre, and whose harmonious performance at our deservedly frequented summer scene of pleasure, has long obtained their highest approbation.  We are told that a severe cold and Hoarseness have hindered his performing for some weeks past, and that he is now incapable of going abroad."

Upon this he was desired with one general acclamation to proceed in the play.  The disturbers of the public were ordered to be silent or to be turned out of the house; and this great actor proved, by the improvement he has made in this character, that excellent as he is, he is still capable of reaching new strokes of perfection; and in the conclusion of the play the applause he met with was the tribute of hearts gratefully agitated through the whole performance with a variety of passions thrown into a ferment by powers most wonderfully suited to tenderness and compassion (+London Chronicle=, 3-6 Dec.).  *pîfdl The Fatal Marriage.

Amongst which I must beg leave to recommend to the Public, the +City of London Lying In Hospital= in Aldersgate Street (for the Benefit of which the Play of the +Conscious Lovers= will be performed this evening at +Covent Garden=); whose charitable doors have been opened for the relief of a much greater Number since the late dearth of Provisions, than its Annual Income (being supported by voluntary contributions) can possibly support, without further aid from the Public."

He being last week at dinner with a set of particular friends, they inquired what Play and Farce he had chose this year for his Benefit.  He inform'd them the +Siege of Damascus= and Lethe.  Lethe, replied a Gentleman is very pleasing, but your friends have seen it, and you must fall into the fashion of having a new additional Scene; for a little bit of novelty may give assistance to its merit, and prove to your advantage.  Why, then, said a facetious Gentleman, who sat very near him, Pray sir, do you write him one; 'twill cost you little trouble, and, you know, you are very capable.  No more capable than yourself, Good Sir, answered the other; but to show I am full as willing, if you'll attempt to please his friends with one, upon my word I'll use my best endeavor to do the same, in writing of another.  We need not fear Severity, for none will blame a friendly inclination to serve a man, who, I believe everyone wishes well.  "Twas agreed, but $Ryan= judiciously observed, 'twould be a shame that two Gentlemen, each capable of writing to give an audience satisfaction, should condescend to make mere Lacqueys of their pens, and send them forth to hold the tail of +Lethe=; therefore if they should once begin, let them each write only one Hour longer, and they might raise a Structure of their own.

The two first acts of this play, as it is performed at the above theatre, were written by $Shakespear=; the three last for the most part by $Mr. Thomson=.  But how a man of $Mr Sheridan='s knowledge (who first introduc'd it there about four years ago) could think of pounding into one substance two things so heterogeneous in their natures as the productions of those authors, is to me amazing.  $Mr Smith= enters in the first act, after having (as we are to suppose) just overcome the +Volsci=r, to the tune of violins and hautboys; but I am a little afraid the grandeur of his triumph is a little misapplied, considering the early times in which $Coriolanus= lived, before the +Roman empire= had arrived to any degree of splendor and magnificence, and was great in virtue only.  However it makes a fine show; and Mr Smith, who has an excellent person, by the help of a little burnt cork and a real coat of mail cuts a very martial appearance.  I think it was one of $the Gracchi=, who, when he was speaking to the people, always had a servant behind him in the Rostrum with a pitch-pipe which he touched whenever he found his master's voice rising beyond a certain height; such an instrument as this would, in my opinion, be of service to Mr Smith, for his fault seems to be that of keeping too much at the top of his vioce.  $Mrs Hamilton= in the part of +Veturai=r, especially in the last act, excells herself; and in particular, she repeats that line: "He never can be lost who saves his country," with the genuine spirit of a free-born +Englishman=.  By the unnatural conjunction which is attempted to be made in this tragedy, most of the other characters are robbed of their significance.

This monstruous production of nonsense and obscenity, is the spawn of one $Ravenscroft=, a writer whose wit was as contemptible as his morals were vitious.  He does not seem to have had one sentiment either of a man of Genious of a gentleman, at least if we may judge by the characters he has daubed, which are a pack of reprobates of the lowest kind.  Nor are the things which look like incidents in this play the produce of his own invention, but the squeezings from an extravagant novel of $Scarron=, and two or three ill-chosen fables of $LaFontaine=; of which ingredients he has contrived to mix up a sort of hog-wash, sweetened with a few luscious expressions and a large portion of the grossest lewdness, to the palates of swine, or what is the same thing, men like them; but which must be odious to, and nauseated by all people of delicate taste, or common modesty.  The three gallants in this comedy, +Townly=r, +Ramble=r and +Loveit=r, never make their appearance upon the stage but to talk bawdy, and that in terms very little different from the most vagabond inhabitants of +Covent Garden=, nor do they make their exit but with a professed intention to commit adultery with one woman or another, who walks off with him very contentedly for that purpose.  I must here observe that adultery is committed no less than seven times during the five acts.  [The play an insult to the +London= aldermen and their wives.]  There were several men of distinction in the boxes at this play, and I think about eight ladies.  What their inward feelings might be I know not; but if one might judge of their thoughts by the gravity of their looks, they were rather mortified than diverted.  But of the women of the town, who as we suppose were unwilling to let slip so fair an opportunity of getting a supper and a bed-fellow, there were crowds both in the pit and green boxes....  *pï dl The Wonder.

[$Mrs Frances Brooke=, in +The Old Maid=, for 8 May 1756, gives the following eye-witness account of the evening: "I determined to watch the artless working of [the Ambassador's] surprise, and to catch, as well as I could his sentiments of the theatre, the Audience, the Play, and the performers.  And shall give them to my readers, just as they appeared to me.  On his first coming to the front of the Box, he was complimented with the Applause of the whole House, which seemed to give him great pleasure, and which he returned by two bows in the +English=, and afterwards by a reverence in the +Moorish manner=, which last I thought very graceful...tho' he is rather low of stature, yet his loose flowing robes, and his manner altogether gave him such an air of superiority, that I thought the Audience looked only like his attendants.  "The House and Spectators attracted his notice so much for some time, that he seem'd very well entertained before the drawing up of the curtain.  At the first scene between the Lords, I thought he looked disappointed, and after a transient view of the stage, directed his eyes again to the company; at the entrance of +King Henry=r his attention was a little recover'd to the performance, but his majesty had not proceeded half way thru the scene, before he burst into a most immoderate fit, of apparently contemptuous laughter, which he repeated very often thro' the whole playing of the part.  The manner in which this stranger was affected by it, amongst other considerations, fully convinces me that this character is most ridiculously burlesqued in the representation, and that both $Shakespeare= and the Monarch are very inhumanly sacrificed, to the polite taste, and elegant distinction of the upper gallery....I could point out many abuses of the like nature, which have increased upon us so much of late, that 'tis almost impossible to attend the theatres, with the expectation of receiving pleasure from some parts of the perfbrmance, without the certainty of suffering equal disgust from others; it was the case of many besides myself, at this of Henry, upon the absurdity of +Winchester=r's brandishing his cane at +Canterbury=r, upon the close of the Council Scene; and yet to give opportunity for this notable stage foolery, the Archbishop and Bishop are both made to walk out of their proper order, tho' in attendance upon the King....His character is drawn by Shakespeare very nearly as it stands in history, and in colours far different from the farcical ones, in which it is the present fashion to represent it.  He is described indeed as imperious, but at the same time a great Monarch, and not withstanding his short interjections of anger, he is in my judgment upon every occasion a King.  I wish this consideration may prevail with $Mr Berry=, when he plays this character for the future, to remember that tho' +Harry=r as well as +Jobson=r may be something rough and boistrous, yet the turbulency of a haughty prince, is a very different quality, and must therefore appear in avery different fashion, from the sawciness of an impudent cobbler.  "Whatever neglect his Moorish Excellency might discover of this part, he paid great attention to that of +Queen Catherine=r; but nothing seem'd to affect him so stronglyas $Miss Young='s singing, at which he appeared quite collected, and listened to her with all marks of rapturous admiration; his whole soul appeared touched, and at the end of the song, he joined the house in clapping, a mark of applause I did not observe him give at any other time.  "I thought upon the King's kissing +Anna Bullen=r, that he appeared surprized and offended, and looked about, to observe whether others were not affected in the same manner.  "The procession was less marked by him than I had expected, but upon the +Champion=r's entry on horseback, he burst into such an Immoderate fit of laughter, as to fall quite back in his seat.  "At the end of the play he rose, as if to leave the House, but looked very well pleased upon being informed there was more entertainment to come; in the Pantomime he seem'd surprized and disgusted at the appearance of +Harlequin=r, to whom he did not appear reconciled to the last; his wonder was still greater at the flying of the +Genii=r cross the stage, and other parts of the machinery, which I thought he studied byt was puzzled to account for.  He laughed heartily at the +Clown=r, and admired +Colombine=r not a little....  "I am jealous of the honour of my country in all respects.  I would have this stranger leave it with as high opinion of our publick entertainments as possible, and could wish that at the Old House, he might see $Mr Garrick= in +Richard=r or some equally striking part, and at the New, he may be present at plays, where rich dresses, magnificent show and graceful action, and uncommon personal perfections in the principal performers might contribute to give him a more elevated idea of our stage, than he can have receiv'd from +King Harry=."]  Receipts: #210 ($Cross=).  *pícg Love for Love.

"Sir: Perhaps there never was a period when the members of the stage were more respected than at present; and this favour consequently proceeds from the decency of their behaviour, and an emulative pride to please that public, whose generosity is an ample reward for their assiduity and perseverance; and when we consider the many qualifications, as well natural as acquired, requisite to constitute a player, surely the most rigid judge will be of opinion that the encouragement is not more than equal to the excellence.  An actor must feel, that is, have the most refined idea of his part, to make an audience feel likewise; and adequate to the pleasures he enjoys in the applause of his approvers, will rise his degree of unhappiness, if by accident or sickness he is obstructed in the execution of his Genius; and should this happen at the era of his benefit, it must then be his misfortune to supplicate that interest which otherwise his merit would have commanded.  "I was led to these reflections by accidentally perusing an advertisement prefix'd to a bill for the benefit of $Mr Lowe=; a performer too well known to need encomiums here; from whom the Town receive no inconsiderable Satisfaction at the theatre, and whose harmonious performance at our deservedly frequented summer scene of pleasure, has long obtained their highest approbation.  We are told that a severe cold and Hoarseness have hindered his performing for some weeks past, and that he is now incapable of going abroad."
