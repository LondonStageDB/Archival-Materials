It was a fine Child born, and would certainly have lived long, had it not fallen into such cruel Hands.  $Davies= (+Dramatic Miscellanies=, III, 260-61): In all the tumults and isturbances of the theatre on the first night of a new play, which was formerly a time of more dangerous service, to the actors, than it has been of late, $Mrs Oldfield= was entirely mistress of herself; she thought it her duty, amidst the most violent opposition and uproar, to exert the utmost of her abilities to serve the author.  In the comedy of uproar, to exert the utmost of her abilities to serve the author.  In the comedy of +the Provoked Husband=, Cibber's enemies tried all their power to get the play condemned.  The reconciliation scene wrought so effectually upon the sensible and generous part of the audience, that the conclusion was greatly and generously approved.  Amidst a thousand applauses, Mrs Oldfield came forward to speak the epilogue; but when she had pronounced the first line,-Methinks I hear some powder'd critic say-a man, of no distinguished appearance, from the seat next to tne orchestra, saluted her with a hiss.  She fixed her eye upon him immediately, made a very short pause, and spoke the words poor creature! loud enough to be heard by the audience, with such a look of mingled scorn, pit, and contempt, that the most uncommon applause justified her conduct in this particular, and the poor reptile sunk down with fear and trembling.

No sooner did poor +Colin=r appear upon the Stage, but his Arrival was usher'd in with a Serenade of Cat Calls, Penny-Trumpets, Clubs, Canes, Hoarse Voices, whistling in Keys, Hells, Fists; and Vollies of whole Oranges; however, the Players went on with uncommon intrepidity, and like the truly great Men, seem'd greater by opposition.  The Audience call'd out for any other Play, Farce or Entertainment, but the +Peasants=r seem'd too intent upon what they were about, to give Ear to them.  This so exasperated the Spectators, that they mustered up all the Artillery they could possibly lay hold and made such an Uproar, during the whole intended Entertainment, that it was scarce possible to hear a word the Actors said.  As every Player came upon the Stage, they call'd upon him by his real, not fictitious Name, and Swore not a Man of them would come to his Benefit.  When $Mrs T@@@= appeared, they call'd out for a Quartern of Gin, to chear up her Spirits.  The Word Constable being first mentioned in the Gallery, it ran round the House like Wild-fire; and immediately the general Cry was, No Constable, no Constable.  At the Conclusion of the Play, a Fellow came upon the Stage, to put out the Lights with his long Pole, but a Gentleman broke it in two, and another taking a Candle from one of the Sockets of the Sconces, his Example was immediately followed by several others, who soon clear'd them of their Lights; when a new kind of Shower compos'd of Candles fell think as Hail on the Stage.  *pi;lif The Beggar's Opera.

The gist of their statement is: (1) They operate under a Patent commencing 1 Sept. 1732 which, by Deaths and Legal Assignments, is the property of the four, with Highmore possessing one half, at an expence of #6,000 and upwards.  (2) Several of the Players have threatened to desert the service of the Patentees and have contracted with some of the Trustees (the Sharers) to secure possession of the Theatre.  (3) Drury Lane is let upon lease from the $Duke of Bedford=, granted to $Thomas Kynaston= and $Francis Stanhope=, Trustees for the Sharers (commonly called Renters) of Drury Lane at the rent of #50 annually upon a Fine of 1,000 guineas paid for the renewal of the lease.  (4) The Players, under the Patentees, have acted at Drury Lane for twenty-one years without any interruption form the Trustees upon the sole contract that the Patentees pay the Trustees #3 12s. each acting night, besides the Liberty of seeing Plays.  (5) At the beginning of this Season the manager's office received a letter from a few of the Renters demanding an Advance of Rent.  Highmore, being new, was concerned, and asked the managers to take care of the matter; and thereafter the signers (the Patentees) had heard of no further discontent among the Renters.  (6) To defend themselves against stories of hardship or complaint by the actors, the Patentees point out that the following weekly salaries had been paid: $Colley Cibber= #12 12s.; $Theophilus Cibber= #5; $Mills Sr=, #1 daily for 200 days certain, and a benefit, clear of all charges; $Mills Jr= #3; $Johnson= #5; $Miller= #5; $Harper= #4; $Griffin= #4; $Shepard= #3; $Hallam=, for himself and his father, the latter of little or no service, #3; $Mrs Heron= #5; $Mrs Butler= #3.  For these charges and others, the Patentees stand a daily expence of #49 when the theatre is open.  (7) Further, the Patentees paid Cibber Jr his wife's whole salary without her being able to act the greater part of the winter, #9 weekly for the two; Mills Jr, in the same circumstances with his wife, #5 10s.  weekly for the two; Miller a salary (amounting to #40) for eight weeks before he acted, and a gratuity of ten guineas; Griffin a present of ten guineas; Harper a present, amount not specified; Mrs Heron an increase form 40s. to #5 weekly, although she refused afterward to play several parts assigned her and acted but seldom.  *po§hay Opera of Operas.

In that mean Time, the Publick waits with Impatience to see the Manifesto of their doubty Chief, $Mr Theophilus Cibber=, which He hath promised in the News-Papers.  It is expected that, in this Manifesto, the young Captain will endeavour to prove that $the King='s Patent, after a solemn Adjudgment in the +Court of Chancery=, is of no Validity; and that picking a Gentleman's Pocket of Six Thousand Pounds is perfectly consistent with the Principles of Liberty.  In the +Daily Post=, 11 June, $Benjamin Griffin=, Comedian, published his Humble Appeal to the Publick.The gist of his statement is: (1) Griffin had been under the management of $Rich= at +Lincoln's Inn Fields=, without any intention of leaving him, when, at the beginning of the season of 1721, the managers at +Drury Lane= sent him messages by $Thurmond Sr= and $Shaw=, seeking Griffin to treat with them.  Griffin at first refused, but $Steede=, then the prompter of Drury Lane, prevailed upon him.  $Wilks= immediately offered the same conditions Griffin had under Rich: #4 weekly and a benefit before 15 April, at the certain incident charge of #40.  Wilks also offered him articles for three years, with a promise of an advance in salary and better terms at that time.  (2) No sooner had Griffin agreed than the masters of both companies entered into a private agreement not to receive any one of the other's company, though discharged, without a private agreement to that purpose.  (3) At the end of three years, under date of 12 December 1724, $R. Castleman=, the treasurer of Drury Lane, sent Griffin a note to the effect that the managers were willing to continue him at 10s. nightly (#3 weekly); as Griffin could not return to Rich, he had to accept the reduction in pay as well as a delay of his benefit to May and a payment of #50 for the charges.  (4) He remained so until 1729, losing in salary #147 besides the #10 extra benefits.  At $Norris=' illness and death, the managers returned him to #4 weekly but kept the charges at #50.  (5) Under date of 4 June 1733, by the signatures of $Mary Wilks=, $Hester Booth=, $John Highmore=, and $John Ellys=, Griffin received a discharge from Drury Lane and full Liberty to treat with Rich or any one else.  He asserts that he had no previous notice and received no reason for his discharge.  *po©king's Griselda.  *co©king's [$P$Princess Royal= and $Princess Amelia= present.]  +Daily Advertiser=, 11 June: After the Performance was over, $Signor Senesino= made his Leave of the Audience, in a short Speech, acquainting them, as he said, with Regret 'That he had now perform'd his last Part on that Stage, and was henceforward discharg'd from any Engagement.'  *po´hay Opera of Operas.
