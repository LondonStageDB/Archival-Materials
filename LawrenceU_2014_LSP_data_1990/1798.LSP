ments have an extensive influence upon the manners of Society.  When well regula
ted, and the pieces for representation well selected both as to matter and manne
r, they may be esteemed friendly to morality, and improvers of public taste.  Bu
t what shall we say when both these ends are disregarded; when moral virtue is b
anished from the scene, and purity of taste is destroyed by affected language an
d pantomimical decorations?  Improvements in almost every art and science have b
een within a few years, rapid and important.  But that is not the case with the 
stage; nor can it be, while Kotzebue and his friends usurp the venerable boards

 precautions to break his fall were not employed With sufficient promptitude.  T
he consequence was that Kemble received several violent contusions, and sprained
 his back in a dangerous manner...The New Opera, in which that actor was to have
 performed a principal part, was necessarily postponed, and the above Entertainm
ents substituted in its place.  A proper apology was made to the audience, as we
ll on account of the unavoidable disappointment, as the incorrectness which migh
