 "that the stage is on its decline." In a long article on "Stage Effect, or Dram
atic Cookery," it concluded that our "Theatrical managers and even our Theatrica
l Critics seem to have resolved all the merit of dramatic composition into stage
 trick, and rest their criterion of Dramatic Genius on the knowledge of what the
y are pleased to call Stage effect."  The "Theatre" article for the month remark
ed upon the boldness of Garrick's opening with the +Beggar's Opera=, "notwithsta
nding he was requested by the +Bench of Justices= at +Bow-Street=, to suppress i
t, as they were of opinion it had done a great deal of mischief among the low cl
ass of people."  +Lloyd's Evening Post=, 17 Sept., included extracts from letter
s against playing the +Beggar's Opera=, "because every performance makes from on
e two twenty thieves."  $Sir John Fielding= and his associates had addressed a l
etter to Garrick requesting him not to perform the opera for the same reason.  T
he +Morning Chronicle=, 23 Sept., praised Garrick for not complying with the Jus
tices' request.  $Wm Augustus Miles= published a +Letter to Sir John Fielding= o
ccasioned by his extraordinary Request to $Mr Garrick= for the suppression of th
e Beggar's Opera (44 pp.).  In this he vindicated the moral effect of the opera.

and Decorations.  [The first of a series of five performances (the last, +Mercha
nt of Venice=, 18 Nov.) which got Macklin dismissed from the theatre until 1775,
 when his lawsuit against six persons whom he claimed formed a conspiracy to his
s him from the stage and ruin his livlihood was concluded favorably for him.  Hi
s performance of +Macbeth= was favorably treated but with certain misgivings in 
the +Morning Chronicle= (25 Oct.), but he was mercilessly criticized in the +Lon
don Evening Post= and +St James Chronicle=: "In Act II, Sc. i, $Shakespeare= has
 made Macbeth murder +Duncan=r; Now Mr $Macklin=, being determined to copy from 
no man, reversed this incident, and in the very first act, scene the second, mur
dered +Macbeth=r."  The favorable review (Morning Chronicle) thought he did well
 in first and last acts, but gave way to stage rant and "vehemence of energetic 
expression" wanting any variation in tone in between.  It also pointed out a cer
tain faulty memory of his lines.  His novel stage effects came in for a paragrap
h of comment:  The alterations in the jeux de theatre respecting the representat
ion of this tragedy do Mr Macklin great credit.  His change of the scenery is pe
culiarly characteristical.  The Quadrangle of Macbeth's castle, and the door whi
ch is supposed to lead to Duncan's apartment (both of which are entirely new) ar
e additions of consequence to the exhibition of the play.  The door also through
 which Macbeth comes to the +Weird Sisters=r, in the 4th act, is a better and mo
re probable entrance than through the common stage portal.  The dresses are new,
 elegant, and of a sort hitherto unknown to a +London= audience, but exceedingly
 proper.  The Banquet was superbly set out, and it must be confessed that the ma
nagers seem to have spared neither cost nor assiduity to ornament and add to the
 effect of the representation."  A favorable letter from a correspondent to the 
London Evening Post adds: "I must observe, Mr Printer, that from the graceful an
d characteristic manner in which Macbeth was introduced by the martial music and
 military procession, from the manner of M. Macklin's acting, from his judicious
 alteration of the dresses, the disposition of the scene where the King is kille
d, the cave of the witches in the 4th act, from the improvement of $Mrs Hartley=
's thinking in +Lady Macbeth=r and from her manner of speaking, which seemed pla
inly to be the effects of some intelligence she had received from Mr Macklin...I
 thought Mr Macklin deserv'd great praise."  See the newspaper comments all gath
ered and reprinted in an +Apology for the Conduct of Charles Macklin=, (London, 
1773).  See also note to 30 Oct.  See also +London Chronicle=, Oct. 23-26 (cf. $
Odell=, I, 453).  The +Westminster Magazine= suggests the performance was pitiab
le.  "Macklin knew what he ought to do, but could not do it."  The Scenemen's pa
y this week was about double the normal cost.  (Account Book).]  Verse Squibs fr
om St James Chronicle (Oct. 1773) against Macklin: @Macbeth@"Eight Kings appear 
and pass over in order, and Banquo the last"@Old $Quin=, ere Fate suppressed his
 lab'ring breath@In studied accents grumbled out Macbeth:--@Next $Garrick= came,
 whose utt'rance truth impressed,@While ev'ry look the tyrant's guilt confess'd:

ds were minute guns, his action starch.@Rough $Holland= too--but pass his errors
 o'er@Nor blame the actor when the man's no more.@Then heavy $Ross=, assay'd the
 tragic frown,@But beef and pudding kept all meaning down:--@Next careless $Smit

.  A column and a half account of the trial appeared in the +Public Advertiser=,
 Saturday 13 May 1775, giving the testimony of the witnesses accused of starting
 the riot, the lawyers, and the judge.  The accused were $Leigh=, $Miles=, $Jame
s=, $Aldus=, and $Clarke=.  The first four were convicted of a conspiracy and a 
riot, the last of a riot only.  During the Course of the Business $Lord Mansfiel
d= took Occasion to observe, that the Right of Hissing, and Applauding in a thea
tre was an unalterable Right, but there was a wide Distinction between expressin
g the natural Sensations of the Mind as they arose on what was seen and heard, a
nd executing a pre-concerted Desagn, not only to hiss an Actor when he was playi
ng a Part in which he was universally allowed to be excellent, but also to drive
 him from the theatre, and effect his utter ruin."  See also $William W. Appleto

 [The play failed to succeed.  Kenrick accounts for the failure in his Preface t
o the 1773 edition by reference to the Macklin affair (See 23 Oct., 30 Oct. and 
18 Nov.)  He quotes from the +Public Advertiser= (22 Nov.): "On Saturday last a 
new comedy called the +Duellist= was performed, for the first time, at +Covent G
arden Theatre=.  Previous to the curtain being drawn up, the following written h
andbill was dispersed about the house.  '$Mr Macklin= has been pursued by a mali
cious party to such a pitch of rancour, that at last they have succeeded so far 
in their cursed designs, as to get him discharged this theatre, and thereby have
 deprived him of the means of a livelihood; therefore if the public have any spi
rit, they will not suffer the new play to begin till $Mr Colman= promises that M
r Macklin shall be engaged again.'  This handbill found its way into the green-r
oom, and had a very visible effect on the performers, as was plainly evident fro
m their confusion.  The piece was received with great marks of approbation, and 
given out again for Monday, which was attended with some hissing, but that was g
reatly overpowered by the general applause of the audience.  The overture to +Th
omas and Sally= being attended to with silence, the greatest part of the author'
s friends quitted the theatre; which being taken advantage of by a party in the 
gallery, a riot ensued, and the entertainment was not suffered to go on till ano
ther play was given out for Monday."  Kenrick agrees with this account, then ana
lyses several other objections which he dismisses, to wit, in the play (a) too l
engthy a satire on lawyers, (b) an indelicate passage in +Latin= (omitted from t
he printed version); in the audience, a conspiracy of $Garrick= and $Bickerstaff
e= against him; and lack of a claque of his own friends to carry through their s
uport of him.  Macklin's name appears on the playroll this night, but only for a
 accumulated 4 days of pay #8 16s. (Account Book).]  Receipts: #221 3s. 6d. (Acc

ertiser= carried a two-column account of +Sethona=, telling the story of the pla
y act by act.  It concluded:  Such is the Story of this new Tragedy which was re
ceived with universal Applause by a crowded and brilliant Audience and seems to 
bid fair to become a Stock Play.  The Parts were judiciously cast, and the Perfo
rmers did great Justice to their respective Characters.  Perhaps $Mrs Barry= nev
er appeared in a greater or more amiable Point of View than on Saturday Night.  
In short her Performance beggared Description; and it is impossible to form an a
dequate Idea of her Merit in +Sethona=r without seeing her.  $Mr Barry= was also
 very great in the +Old Hermit=r, and exhibited as pathetic and as chaste a piec
e of acting as we remember to have seen.  The Dresses, Decorations and Scenery o
f this Play are much superior to those of any modern Tragedy; they do ample Just
ice to the Author, and likewise do Honour to the Taste and Spirit of the Manager
, who seems to have spared no Expence to furnish a splendid and rational Enterta
inment.  The Scene of the Temple of +Osiris=r, and the View of the +Egyptian Cat
acombs=v were particularly admired, and are worthy of the Brush of $Mr Loutherbo
urg=.  The +Prologue= is a very classical Performance, and was well delivered by
 $Mr Reddish=, notwithstanding the noise and the frequent Interruption usual on 
these occasions.  The +Epilogue= in the character of an +Egyptian Fortune Teller
=r was admirably spoken by Mrs Barry, and had an amazing effect.  It contains so
me excellent Strokes of Satire on the Times and a rich vein of Humour which is f
inely sustained throughout.  From several Circumstances we should suppose this E
pilogue to be the Production of our +English Roscius= and it seems to be one of

draw the line of our expectation.  His figure is at present lank, awkward, and u
nengaging; his voice distinctly powerful, but inharmonious; his action outre, vu
lgar and forced: his attitudes unnatural, affected and disgustful; and his deliv
ery a continued rant, without proper change, a pleasing variety, or a just discr
imination of the necessary difference of tone demanded by the different passions
.  These...capital defects...are not unsurmountable...The play was prefaced by a
 new +Prologue=, evidently the production of Mr Garrick.  It had some humor and 
was well received.  The purport of it was to beg favor for the hero of the eveni
ng, whom it compared to a young swimmer, who had tried to float in two shallow s
treams, and was now about to venture himself in the great deep.  This image is c
ertainly an apt one, though, it is no great compliment to the audiences of +Norw

 Beauty from that sequestered habitation to which by mystic spells he had long b
een doomed, appears to ratify their union, and astonishes the spectators by his 
magic influence, in a glorious vision of that felicity the virtues of the happy 
pair had so justly insured.  An admirable vaudeville, and a grand dance, conclud
e the dramatic entertainment....Had it not appeared obvious that the whole was i
ntended as a mere vehicle for the splendid spectacle, we do not suppose, in spit
e of the managers Orders and Puffs, that the author's labors would have been tol
erated.  The very excellent scenery, however, of the ingenious Mr Loutherbourg p

It is a very great insult to respectable citizens and gentlemen of moderate fort

ey admit too men in liveries.  Their prices of admission have been raised within
 these thirty years, and every art practised for interest of the managers; and i
n these times, when every necessary and convenience of life is considerably enha
nced, it is a matter of prudence in persons of the middle rank of life to prefer
 the gallery to the pit.  But this is no reason why livery servants should be al
lowed to place themselves by the wives and daughters of private gentlemen and re
putable tradesmen, to whom they often behave with great insolence and indecency.
  [It is desirable] to know why a constable does not make his appearance in the

withdrawing the piece to remove those imperfections in the first representation 
which were too obvious to escape reprehension, and too numerous to admit of hast
y correction."  He blames his inexperience and want of judgment in theatrical ef
fects, the extreme length of the play act by act, and haste in writing.  From th
e +Westminster Magazine= Feb., which outlined the plot in five columns:  The pre
sent state of the Rivals is widely different from that in which we found it on t
he first night's representation.  +Sir Lucius O'Trigger=r being re-touched, has 
now the appearance of a character; and his assigning +Beverley=r's reflection on
 his country as the grounds for his desire to quarrel with him, is a reasonable 
pretence, and wipes off the former stigma undeservedly thrown on the sister King
dom.  An alteration of a principal incident gave a very favorable turn to the fa
ble and the whole piece: that where young +Acres=r now delivers his challenge to
 his friend +Absolute=r, begging him to carry it to his Rival Beverly, not knowi
ng the two characters composed but one man; its being at first given to Sir Luci

ared in the Feb. +Westminster Magazine=, concluding: "In point of dialogue, poet
ry or music, it is inferior to few, if any, of the modern attempts of a similar 
kind; amongst which number, however, we desire to be understood not to include t
he ribald, unmeaning, sing-song compilations of the monotonous $Mr Dibdin=.  The
 Fable, indeed, is too light and trival to endure the severity of a critical ana
lysis; but it is at least sufficiently important to serve as a vehicle for the m
usic; and the catastrophe has peculiar vivacity and theatrical spirit.  Upon the
 whole the author has fully answered the end he proposed of introducing a deserv
ing young composer whose name, it seems is Carter, to the public and who more th
an promises to be a composer of taste and genius.  In this his first performance
 he both received and deserved the greatest encouragement and applause.  $Mr Wes
ton= spoke a humorous +Epilogue= accompanied by a large dog named $Dragon=, whic
h had a very good effect, but as it was poor Dragon's first time of appearing on
 the stage, he, like all young performers of true feeling, seemed a good deal fr

he audience, the most impartial I ever saw, sat mute for two acts, and seemed de

had been so lavishly trumpeted.  At the third act they grew pleased and interest
ed; at the fourth they were cooled and deadened by two unneccessary scenes, but 
at the catastrophe in the fifth they were transported.  They clapped, shouted, h
ussaed, cried bravo, and thundered out applause."  Commends $Mrs Yates=, and hop

briefly:  +St Patrick's day= is replete with broad humor, homely jests, and extr

nd observation; the situations were whimsical and produced that mirth which the 
audience in the +Prologue= were invited to partake of....The jests were occasion
ally too low and vulgar, and his scene too extravagantly absurd.  The main drift
 of the +Prologue= was to tell the Audience that a fine Spring impeded the theat
rical harvest; and that at this season the benefits of Nature were the greatest

 of plot and intrigue, that it demands an Unusual degree of attention in the per
formers and audience to excite admiration.  On Saturday they seemed averse to as
sist the author.  Mr King in +Witwou'd=r was as entertaining and full of spirits
 as usual.  $Mr Jefferson= in the gay admired +Mirabel=r (independent of the ant
ique mode of his wig, and formal cut of his clothes, which surely were both unch
aracteristic) seemed in attempting to be quite natural, to keep the entire plot

e nervous, and played the latter part of his character well....Mrs Abington's pe
rson, manner and dress were fashionable and elegant; but though the character wa
s certainly a fine one, there was a want of that spirit best calculated to call 
her powers into action: her delivery was tediously formal; and had the audience 
been deprived of their sight they would conclude that +Capt. Bobadill=r had got

e two additional scenes we were summoned by the bills to behold, are two of the 
late memorable regatta:-The first is a perspective of +Ranelagh Gardens=v to the
 water, illuminated with party-coloured lamps, which terminates with the tempora
ry obelisk erected on that occasion:-Behind this we just catch the streamers of 
the barges and etc., supposed to be rowing up to the stairs, and landing their c
ompany, to martial music and under the discharge of cannon, imitated by the unna
tural slamming of one of the Green Room doors.  This scene, however, had a toler
able appearance, but being on too confined a scale, its intended effect must hav
e been lost.  The other represented the inside of as much of the +Temple of Nept
une=v as was possible to give the spectators in a theatre:-we cannot extol it by
 any means as a perfect representation:-and to prevent it coming too near the or
iginal, +Harlequin=r, +Perot=r, +Pantaloon=r, and etc. were made to lounge in th
e orchestra instead of its being occupied by a good band of music:-in short the 
whole pantomime went off rather flat.  It is recommended to the managers here ne

orward in +Benedict=r much earlier than was expected.  It cannot be a matter of 
surprise that +Roscius= should have escaped the infection and his spirits and co
nstitution seems proof against the attacks of age itself; after above 30 campaig
ns, his ardour and execution appear rather to increase.  Benedict owes all its c
onsequence to his attachment; there is a peculiar turn of humour in this soldier
 that none but Mr Garrick has ever been able to enter into the true spirit of.  
Last night he supported the character with undiminished excellence, and in the s
peech where he meditates and then resolves on marriage, he soared beyond himself

o cups on porcelain, and a spoon made of the beak of an +Indian bird=, which is

 The Outer Gate of the Seraglio--An Interior view of it--and a Garden terminatin

her powers may enable her to execute when placed in a situation that calls them 
forth.  But from the speciman she gave there is not room to expect anything beyo

her voice (that requisite of all public speakers) is far from being favourable t
o her progress as an actress.  It is feared she possess a monotone not to be got
 rid of; there is also vulgarity in her tones, ill calculated to sustain that li
ne in a theatre she has at first been held forth in; but as these observations a

 and unembarassed.  Those are his excellencies, and considering it was his first
 performance, he seems to possess them in a degree far superior to the various c
andidates for theatrical fame which the managers of both houses have brought for
ward for some years past.  On the other hand he is aukward, and in some parts un
animated.  His arms are too long, or he flung them about in a very disgusting ma
nner.  He seemed to express the sense of his author much better than his own fee
lings.  His voice though full, wants variety and modulation; not but on some occ
asions he managed it with infinite grace and judgement.  But if this want of var
iety of tones and extent of voice, which is so indispensibly necessary to consti
tute a first rate actor, be not the effect of Nature, the Public may behold with
 less anxiety their decayed veterans giving nightly proofs of their increasing i

 return from +Italy=) been a student under that most excellent musician $Dr Boyc
e=.  This composition must be allowed to be an extraordinary effort of genius in
 so young a man.  The Fugue of the overture is masterly.  The song of  '+There i
n old Arden's inmost shade=,' is well suited to the scene described by the poet.
...But what we think most deserving of praise is the power our young composer ha
s shown in the chorusses....From the general and sincere applause with which the
 Ode was received, we may venture to pronounce, that if Mr Linley Jr pursues his
 studies, he will one day stand foremost in the list of modern composers."]  *pc

acMillan='s note from $Kemble= differs slightly.]  [A full column letter for the
 +Morning Chronicle= this date from $Theatricus= to Garrick protested the fact t
hat his announced benefit for the +Theatrical Fund= on the 30th of May would be 
all sold out to the highest bidders for tickets; that a nobleman offering ten Gu
ineas for four box seats would get them in preference to the tradesmen who offer
ed only a pound, the stated price of the tickets.  Since charity was the cause t
his writer suggested that Garrick give a second benefit night to the Fund, with 
the hopes (1) that the Fund would be thereby vastly increased, and (2) that oppo
rtunity might be given for twice as many People to see a Garrick final performan
ce.  It was, perhaps, in response to this public request that Garrick gave a sec
ond Benefit night for the Fund on 10 June.  The +Morning Post=,  29 May, noted: 
"The concourse of servants assembled yesterday morning at seven o'clock, at +Dru
